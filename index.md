## Welcome to my project site.

This is where I will post code that I have created, solutions to class projects and other related material.

My projects are backed on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and this site is coded in ruby and built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).


### Neural Network Toolkit + GUI.

My neural network toolkit is a revised version of a University of Washington professor's matlab script to simulate single, leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. This toolkit enables connections between neurons to simulate neural networks and more novel methods of analysis for these networks.

Both the script for the graphical interface and the simulation script must be downloaded as data analysis takes part on both front and back end.
